- 🎯 **Target Quality:** 95% with "how did you know that?" reactions

### **Quality Framework Requirements:**

**Deep Psychological Intelligence:**
- **Identity archaeology** - professional persona vs. inner reality gaps
- **Emotional forensics** - surface → hidden → denied → root cause pain analysis
- **Contradiction hunting** - psychological patterns they don't recognize
- **Voice authenticity** - language that sounds like overheard therapy sessions
- **Belief system mapping** - surface → private → unconscious beliefs
- **Jungian + LAB + JTBD + Cognitive bias analysis** - comprehensive frameworks

**Conversion Intelligence Application:**
- **Ad testing hypotheses** - MintCRO/Curt Maly micro-budget testing approach
- **Conversion mechanisms** - psychological triggers that drive purchases
- **Content strategy** - short-form and long-form that converts
- **Offer development** - what they'll actually buy and at what price points
- **Campaign execution** - complete funnel optimization strategy

### **"Best in World" Marketing Criteria:**
- ✅ Scary accurate psychological insights that competitors can't replicate
- ✅ Conversion campaigns based on deep psychological truth
- ✅ Marketing intelligence that drives immediate business results
- ✅ Voice of customer so authentic it sounds like real conversations
- ✅ Identity transformation positioning beyond just business benefits
