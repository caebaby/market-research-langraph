- **JTBD Purchase Psychology** (functional, social, emotional jobs)
- **Cognitive Biases & Decision Shortcuts** analysis
- **Voice of Customer Language Maps** (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU funnel stages)
- **Identity transformation insights** (not just business metrics)

### **Journal-Level Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Client reactions: "How did you know that?"
- ✅ Psychological contradictions revealed
- ✅ Authentic voice patterns (sounds like real customers)
- ✅ Behavioral predictions with specificity
- ✅ Identity crisis analysis and transformation roadmaps

## 🚀 Current Development Phase

### **Phase 1: Prompt Optimization (In Progress)**
- **Status**: Testing intensified psychological analysis prompts
- **Goal**: Achieve 95% quality with journal-level depth
- **Approach**: Enhanced psychological frameworks + multi-pass analysis
- **Test Context**: Axiom Planning Resources (financial advisors)

### **Phase 2: Search Integration (Planned)**
- **Purpose**: Add web research capabilities for voice validation
- **Tools**: Tavily API or DuckDuckGo for authentic customer voice

- **Benefits**: Real customer language from forums, reviews, discussions

### **Phase 3: Advanced Multi-Agent Features (Future)**
- **Competitor Intelligence Agent**: Market positioning analysis
- **Voice Research Agent**: Authentic customer language mining
- **Campaign Optimization Agent**: Conversion psychology refinement
- **Quality Validation Agent**: Psychological insight verification

## 📋 Current Testing & Validation

### **Testing Strategy:**
1. **Manual Prompt Testing**: Validate psychological depth before agent implementation
2. **Agent System Testing**: Compare manual vs. agent output quality
3. **Cross-Context Testing**: Verify session isolation across different businesses
4. **Quality Benchmarking**: Measure against consulting-grade standards

### **Test Cases:**
- **Primary**: Axiom Planning Resources (financial advisors)
- **Secondary**: Pet Paradise Supplies (e-commerce)
