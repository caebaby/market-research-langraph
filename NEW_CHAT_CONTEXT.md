Financial advisory firm, established 2010, $2.8M revenue, 7 advisors.
Recent trigger: Tuesday 4:30pm, lead advisor Mark left meeting when 
owner said 'closers close' for the third time. Mark texted me: 
'I didn't get my CFP to be a used car salesman in a suit.'
Physical impact: 3 advisors on anxiety meds, 2 considering career change.
Quote from advisor: 'My 12-year-old asked why I look sad at dinner. 
I couldn't tell her it's because I spent the day pushing products 
I wouldn't buy myself.'
Failed attempts: Tried fee-only model for 6 months, panicked when 
income dropped 40%, switched back but feels worse than before.
3AM thought: 'Is this really the legacy I want - helping Hartford 
Insurance more than the Hartford families who trust me?'

## System Overview
Building a 6-agent marketing intelligence system using LangChain/LangGraph deployed on Railway. The system performs deep psychological analysis + conversion intelligence + competitive intelligence with web search.

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Interview Agents Broken (Priority 1)
- **Problem**: Interview methods in `prompts/research_prompts.py` were outside the class (indentation error)
- **Fix Applied**: Moved methods inside ResearchPrompts class with proper 4-space indentation
- **Status**: Need to deploy and test
- **Impact**: Missing 40% of intelligence (no conversational depth or voice patterns)

### 2. Quality Below Expectations
- **Problem**: Output is ~90% quality but lacks "holy shit how did you know that?" depth
- **Root Causes**:
  - Temperature too low (0.2) - needs 0.7-0.8
  - Max tokens too low (4000) - needs 8000-12000
  - Missing interview agents reducing depth
  - Using older Claude model

### 3. Claude 4 Now Available!
- **New Models** (released July 10, 2025):
  - `claude-opus-4-20250514` - For complex/deep analysis
  - `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` - For standard tasks
- **Recommendation**: Use Opus 4 for psychological analysis, Sonnet 4 for others

## Technical Details
- **Deployment**: Railway at https://market-research-langraph-production.up.railway.app/
- **Cost**: Only $0.55/day currently - plenty of room to increase quality
- **Brave Search**: Working correctly (verified in logs)
- **Files to Update**:
  - `prompts/research_prompts.py` - Fix indentation ✓
  - `agent/graph.py` - Update ResearchConfig with new models and parameters

## Next Steps
1. Deploy indentation fix
2. Update to Claude 4 models with higher temperature/tokens
3. Test full 6-agent system
4. Verify interview agents are generating conversations
5. Check if quality reaches "uncomfortable accuracy" level

## Success Criteria
