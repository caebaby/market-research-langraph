├── Interview Simulation Agent (not connected)
├── Campaign Synthesis Agent (not connected) 
└── Multi-Agent Coordinator (not connected)
```

### **Target System (Level 10 Enterprise):**
```
Sophisticated Multi-Agent Intelligence:
├── ICP Research Agent (with comprehensive psychological frameworks)
├── Interview Simulation Agent (realistic customer conversations)
├── Campaign Synthesis Agent (GTM copy, conversion assets)
├── Competitor Intelligence Agent (market positioning)
├── Output Formatting Agent (professional reports)
└── Multi-Agent Coordinator (orchestrates all agents)
```
