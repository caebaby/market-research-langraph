## 🔄 Recent Development Session Summary

### **Agent Status Clarification:**
- ✅ **Psychological Research Agent**: Operational and producing deep insights
- ✅ **Conversion Intelligence Agent**: Operational and transforming psychology into marketing intelligence
- ❌ **Interview Simulation Agent**: Basic version exists but needs major enhancement
- ❌ **Campaign Synthesis Agent**: Basic version exists but needs enhancement

**Corrected Current Status**: Only 2 agents are truly operational, not 3 as previously thought.

### **Prompt Management Strategy Decided:**
- **Keep all prompts in `prompts/research_prompts.py`** - don't break into separate files
- **Test prompt improvements via LangGraph Playground** (not code-based testing)
- **A/B test process**: Copy prompt → test in Playground → replace when better version found
- **4 current prompts**: deep_psychological_research, conversion_intelligence, interview_simulation, campaign_synthesis

### **Quality Enhancement Focus:**
- **Target**: "How the hell did you know that?" level insights already built into prompt framework
- **Current quality**: 85-90% baseline with dual intelligence system
